# Description
Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the **vertical order** traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).

The **vertical order** traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

**Example 1:**
![](https://github.com/JiayingLi0803/StrugglingLeetCode/blob/main/Figures/Problem987_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```
**Example 2:**

![](https://github.com/JiayingLi0803/StrugglingLeetCode/blob/main/Figures/Problem987_2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```
**Example 3:**

![](https://github.com/JiayingLi0803/StrugglingLeetCode/blob/main/Figures/Problem987_3.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.
```
**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
# Solution
**Approach 1: DFS**
```ruby
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        l = []
        def DFS(col, row, node):
            if node is not None:
                l.append((col,row,node.val))
                DFS(col-1,row+1,node.left)
                DFS(col+1,row+1,node.right)
        DFS(0,0,root)
        l.sort()
        ret = []
        curr_column_index = l[0][0]
        curr_column = []
        for column, row, value in l:
            if column == curr_column_index:
                curr_column.append(value)
            else:
                # end of a column, and start the next column
                ret.append(curr_column)
                curr_column_index = column
                curr_column = [value]
        # add the last column
        ret.append(curr_column)
        return ret
```
**Approach 2: BFS**
```ruby
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        node_list = []

        def BFS(root):
            queue = deque([(root, 0, 0)])
            while queue:
                node, row, column = queue.popleft()
                if node is not None:
                    node_list.append((column, row, node.val))
                    queue.append((node.left, row + 1, column - 1))
                    queue.append((node.right, row + 1, column + 1))

        # step 1). construct the global node list, with the coordinates
        BFS(root)

        # step 2). sort the global node list, according to the coordinates
        node_list.sort()

        # step 3). retrieve the sorted results partitioned by the column index
        ret = OrderedDict()
        for column, row, value in node_list:
            if column in ret:
                ret[column].append(value)
            else:
                ret[column] = [value]

        return ret.values()
```
